This directory holds various mapping examples to understand and test what the Whistle mapping framework can accomplish.

The idea is that when the mapping command is ran (TODO), it will run a specific example from this directory or it will run all examples. It will also give feedback for how the output compares to the expected output.

Copy the _t directory, name it as needed (but prefix with eg#- where # is an example number), and then populate the files inside the directory to setup the example.
